This page explains how to integrate and configure dbt with nao for advanced analytics and data transformation workflows.

<Tip>
**Why do I need to configure dbt?**

If you have dbt working you get:

- Execute & preview dbt models
- Auto-complete of models columns, jump to refs
- Column-level lineage in your agent

Without dbt, you still get:

- Agent who can create & edit: dbt models, dbt sources, dbt documentation & tests
</Tip>

## Access dbt onboarding panel

To configure dbt, open the "dbt configuration" panel.
It is available in the home page of nao, or at the left of the bottom bar.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>

</div>

Then follow the dbt configuration process.

## Steps in the dbt Onboarding

The dbt onboarding panel guides you through the following steps to ensure your dbt project is correctly set up in nao:

1. **Enable dbt**  
   Activate dbt features in nao, such as SQL x jinja compilation, completions, lineage, and dbt tools for AI agent.
2. **Python Interpreter**  
   Select the Python interpreter for your dbt project or create a new environment.
3. **Packages**  
   Choose the dbt version and install the required warehouse adapters.
4. **Project Configuration**  
   Set the folder paths for your `dbt_project.yml` and `profiles.yml` files.
5. **Environment Variables**  
   Add any environment variables needed for your dbt project. Add them one by one in the form here, or by creating a .nao.env file. If you already have a .env file, nao will read the environment variables from here.
6. **Target**  
   Select the dbt target (from your `profiles.yml`) to use for this project.

## Check dbt setup status

When your dbt project is working, you will have a tick on the bottom left here. If not, it will be a cross. If it's still not working, you can click on the "dbt project" button and open the dbt configuration panel again.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src="/images/dbt_status.png" alt="dbt project status indicator" width="500" />
</div>

## Setup dbt defer

Use dbt defer to preview your models using production data when development data is not available.

> 1. Go to dbt config panel at by clicking dbt icon at the bottom of the screen (see picture above in check dbt setup status)
>
> 2. Scroll down to dbt defer section and check "Enable defer"  
>    <img src="/images/dbt_defer.png" alt="dbt defer section" width="500" />
>    
> 3. Add your production manifest file  
>    
>
> 4. Toggle defer mode when on a dbt model. This will use production data instead of dev data when missing, to preview your dbt model.
