nao indexes your codebase to provide fast, relevant answers and code suggestions, with the context of your existing repository and data schema.

<Info>
**How does this help nao agent?**
- It gives the agent the full context of your repository – its structure, and code style
- It gives the agent precise context on your data schema – to make sure the generated code matches your data
- It allows the agent to answer questions about your codebase or data warehouse
</Info>

## What is indexed?
- All **files** in your repository – except those in `.gitignore` or `.naoignore`
- All **table schemas** in your data warehouse

## Is indexing automatic?
If you selected **"auto-indexing"** at onboarding:
- When opening a new folder / data connection, the indexing will be launched automatically and will take a few minutes to complete.
- Re-indexing will be automatically triggered every 10 minutes.

If not:
- You can trigger manual indexing from the settings / AI models panel
- You can also re-activate auto-indexing from this panel

## How can I check the indexing status?
- Go to the **settings / AI models panel** to check the status of both codebase & warehouse indexing
